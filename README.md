****Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**** is a crucial step for data scientists to delve into datasets, unravel insights, and summarize key characteristics, often leveraging data visualization techniques. As an aspiring Data Scientist, I've conducted an EDA on a dataset containing information about employees at ABC company. Let's outline the steps involved:

**Step 1: Import Python Libraries**
Import all necessary libraries for data loading, statistical analysis, visualizations, data transformations, merges, and joins.

**Step 2: Reading Dataset**
Utilize the Pandas library to load data into a DataFrame, allowing easy access to various file formats such as CSV, JSON, Excel, SQL, and more, using functions like `read_csv()`.

**Step 3: Data Preprocessing**
Understand the data by examining its structure, dimensions, data types, and identifying missing values using statistical summaries and descriptive statistics. This step also involves handling duplicates and addressing null values through dropping or filling.

*Deriving Statistical Summary:*
Use the `describe()` function to obtain a statistical summary, offering insights into outliers, data entry errors, and the distribution of numerical data.

*Checking for Duplicate and Null Values:*
Leverage `nunique()` to identify unique values and `isnull().sum()` to spot missing records in each column. Handle duplicates based on further analysis and address null values by dropping or filling them.

*Dropping or Filling Data:*
Consider dropping columns or rows with null values or filling them with appropriate values such as 0, mean, or median.

**Step 4: Data Analysis**
Retrieve meaningful insights from the preprocessed data.

**Step 5: Data Visualization**
Utilize various types of graphs, such as line graphs, scatter plots, and bar plots, to visualize data. In this analysis, I've used a scatter plot to showcase the correlation between employees' salary and age. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are employed for plotting, with Seaborn built on top of Matplotlib, offering concise code for statistical plots.

By following these steps, a comprehensive EDA can uncover patterns, anomalies, and trends within the dataset, laying the foundation for more in-depth analyses and informed decision-making.
